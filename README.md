# Snake, Water, Gun Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic "Snake, Water, Gun" game, a variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors. In this game, the player competes against the computer, each choosing one of three options: Snake, Water, or Gun. The outcome is determined based on the choices made by both sides.

## Game Rules

1. **Snake (s)** defeats **Water (w)** but loses to **Gun (g)**.
2. **Water (w)** defeats **Gun (g)** but loses to **Snake (s)**.
3. **Gun (g)** defeats **Snake (s)** but loses to **Water (w)**.

## How to Play

1. The computer randomly selects one of the three options: Snake, Water, or Gun.
2. You, the player, are prompted to make your choice by entering:
   - `s` for Snake
   - `w` for Water
   - `g` for Gun
3. The game compares your choice with the computer's choice and displays the result:
   - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.
   - Otherwise, the winner is determined based on the game rules above.
